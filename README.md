# Advent of Code 2020
Scratch / Solution files for advent of code 2020

## Day 1
Solved with a little bit of "smarts" but really a brute force given the size of the domain and simplicity of the request. Put in some code reuse and reduced the search space.

## Day 2
Solved with a little regex and implementation of the required logic

## Day 3
Solved by mapping into a matrix and a little traversal logic. Debated pure mapping, but figured a loop was sufficient.
